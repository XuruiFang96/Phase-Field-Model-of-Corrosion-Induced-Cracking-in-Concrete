# Electrochemical-chemical-mechanical phase field model for non-uniform corrosion-induced cracking considering the rust precipitation
#This repository contains the implementation of a phase-field model designed to simulate corrosion induced cracking in concrete. The model captures the degradation mechanisms driven by corrosion-induced expansion and cracking. It is suitable for research and development purposes in computational mechanics, material science, and civil engineering.
