# Phase-field Model of Sulfate Attack
#This repository contains the implementation of a phase-field model designed to simulate sulfate attack in concrete. The model captures the degradation mechanisms driven by sulfate-induced expansion and cracking. It is suitable for research and development purposes in computational mechanics, material science, and civil engineering.
