# Phase-field-Model-of-Corrosion-Induced-Cracking-in-Concrete
#This repository contains the implementation of five different phase-field models designed to simulate corrosion-induced cracking in concrete (COMSOL 6.3). I will update them one by one. It is suitable for research and development purposes in computational mechanics, material science, and civil engineering. If you would like other programs not offered here, please contact me!
